# 3. Attitudinal Foundations of Mindfulness
## Non-Judging
* Become aware of how often we judge and choosing not to be swept away by those judgments.
## Patience
* It's about allowing things to unfold in their own time without forcing them.
## Beginner's mind
* It's about embracing a beginner's mind and to foster openness and eagerness to learn. A new perspective where we do not attach to our knowledge.
## Trust
* Involves having confidence in your own intuition and wisdom. It's about trusting your feelings and the process of mindfulness itself.
## Non-Striving
* It's about letting go of the need to achieve specific outcomes and instead engaging in activities for their own sake. NOT FORCE ANYTHING BUT EXPERIENCING THE PRESENT MOMENT.
## Acceptance
* Acceptance is about seeing things as they are rather than how we want them to be. RECOGNIZE REALITY AND START WORKING FROM THERE.
