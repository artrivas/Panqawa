* A path is represented by $P$ and its length (number of edges) is denoted by $P^{k}$, $k$ can be 0.
* Some notations:$$\begin{aligned}
P^\circ &:= x_1 \dots x_{k-1},\\
P\,x_i^\circ &:= x_0 \dots x_{i-1},\\
x_i^\circ\,P &:= x_{i+1} \dots x_k,\\
x_i^\circ\,P\,x_j^\circ &:= x_{i+1} \dots x_{j-1}.
\end{aligned}$$
* $P = x_{0} \dots x_k$ is called and $A-B$ path if $V(P) \cap B = \{x_k\}$ and $V(P) \cap A = \{x_0\}$
* Two or more path are called **independent** if none of them contains an **inner vertex** of another.
* Given a graph H, we call P and H-path if P is non-trivial and meets H exactly in its ends. In particular, the edge of any H-path of length 1 is never an edge of H.
* The length of a cycle it's the number of its edges or vertices and it is denoted by $C^k$ where $k$ is its length.
* **Girth:** Minimum length of a cycle in a graph G. $g(G)$
* **Circumference:** Maximum length of a cycle in a graph G.
* When a graph does not have cycles, then their girth and circumference is set to 0 and $\infty$.
* **Chord:** A cord of a cycle C is an edge that has both endpoints in V(C) but does not belong to E(C). This is an example:

* FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IS THAT A INDUCED GRAPH IS A SUB-GRAPH WHERE YOU KEEP ALL THE EDGES FROM THE ORIGINAL GRAPH THAT HAVE BOTH ENDPOINTS IN S (YOUR INNER GRAPH), AND IT CAN BE REPRESENTED BY G-{VERTICES YOU'VE REMOVED}.
* **Induced cycle:** It has not chords, therefore it also is a induced sub-graph.
* **If a graph has large minimum degree, it contains long paths and cycles** (?)
> **Proposition 1.3.1.** Every graph G contains a path of length $\delta (G)$ and a cycle of length at least $\delta (G) + 1$ (provided that $\delta (G) \geq 2$).
	Proof:
		First of all notice that $\delta (G) \geq 2$ makes G to have cycles.
		 Let P be our largest path in G, so let x be a vertex that belongs to P, therefore if all neighbours of x are in P, then $k \geq d(x)$ and if it has a vertex outside of P, then because of $\delta (G) \geq 2$ that vertex belongs to a cycle, therefore it has to come back, making P larger (contradiction).

> **Proposition 1.3.2.** Every graph G containing a cycle satisfies $g(G) \leq 2diam(G) +1$ 
> 	Proof:
> 		By contradiction let's suppose that $g(G) \geq 2diam(G) +2$, so the largest path in that cycle is at least $diam(G) +1$ which in G is only achievable if there is a path that unifies those vertex, but the problem is that by making that, those vertex becomes chords, making that set of vertex a shorter cycle which is a contradiction.
