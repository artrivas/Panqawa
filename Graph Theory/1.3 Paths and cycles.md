* A path is represented by $P$ and its length (number of edges) is denoted by $P^{k}$, $k$ can be 0.
* Some notations:$$\begin{aligned}
P^\circ &:= x_1 \dots x_{k-1},\\
P\,x_i^\circ &:= x_0 \dots x_{i-1},\\
x_i^\circ\,P &:= x_{i+1} \dots x_k,\\
x_i^\circ\,P\,x_j^\circ &:= x_{i+1} \dots x_{j-1}.
\end{aligned}$$
* $P = x_{0} \dots x_k$ is called and $A-B$ path if $V(P) \cap B = \{x_k\}$
